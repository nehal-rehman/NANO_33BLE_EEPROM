### Arduino Programmer (Nano 33 BLE + SEN0161-V2)

**1x Nano 33 BLE**
Lacks EEPROM necessary to function with SEN0161-V2 and requires updating source code.

**1x DF Robot PH v2 (SEN0161-V2)**

1x NanoBLEFlashPrefs - Git_Link
Arduino Nano 33 BLE and 33 BLE Sense do not have an EEPROM where you can store any parameters permanently. This library allows storing parameters and preferences between program restarts and reflashing.

**TASK**
To replace EEPROM read/write with NanoBLE
